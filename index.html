          <p>Plastics (or plastics) are materials from artificial or natural high molecular compounds (polymers). Synthetic polymers are the most common. People are advised to collect all species together clean and dry. At special points, they are
            separated by markings and sent to waste processing plants. Some species are not recycled and burned or buried in landfills.
